I'm currently a first-year master's student at the School of Big Data, Fudan University. My research interests primarily involve large language models and multimodal agents.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Yang Deqing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uZdQxkwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) of Fudan KW lab, Fudan University.
